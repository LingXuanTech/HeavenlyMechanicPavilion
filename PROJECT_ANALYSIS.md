## Performance Analysis

### Backend Performance 🚀

**Current State**: Unknown (no benchmarks)

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
1. LLM API latency (5-10s per call)
2. Database queries (N+1 patterns possible)
3. Vendor API calls (no caching visible)
4. No connection pooling mentioned

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Multi-layer caching strategy
- Database query optimization
- LLM response caching
- Batch vendor requests
- Async processing throughout

### Frontend Performance 🎨

**Current State**: Typical Next.js app

**Optimization Opportunities**:
